                    Hi! My name is Claire Falzone. Until November 2020, I was a developer at Elkhorn
                    Computer Service in
                    Elkhorn, NE, area code 68022. For my job I wrote, maintained, and deployed serverless microservices
                    on AWS Lambda in Python. For my personal side projects I like to use C, C++,
                    and Rust; I find low-level programming a lot of fun.

                <br> <br>
                    My work email address used to be obtainable by running the following program:<br>

                    <!-- Code snippets have to be unindented because the `.code-snippet` selector
                         in the CSS has the value  `pre`  for  the `white-space` property.  I did
                         this so that  I  wouldn't have to type a bunch of  `&nbsp;`  to properly
                         indent code snippets. -->

                    <div class="code-snippet"
>// Let's see the spambots harvest this one lol
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    const char *email_caesar_3 = "GdqwhChonkruqvhuylfh1frp";
    int i = 0;
    while (*(email_caesar_3 + i)) {
        putchar(*(email_caesar_3 + i++) - 3);
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}</div>
            </div>
        </div>
