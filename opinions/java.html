            A <a href="https://github.com/pdush">friend of mine</a> recently undertook to learn programming. For their first
            programming language they chose Python, which I think is an excellent first language; it is a powerful, expressive,
            and useful language that is very easy for beginners to learn. I may be a little biased by the fact that Python was
            <em>my</em> first language, but I think those familiar with Python would agree.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I asked this person what language they would like to learn after Python, and they said they were thinking of doing
            Java, because they knew someone who was doing stuff in Java. I told them that they shouldn't learn Java until they've
            learned a few other languages first, but I wasn't able to give a super good explanation as to why. So here I hope to
            explain myself.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Java is badly designed</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>    
            Consider the following Java code:
        </p><p> 
            <code>
                <!-- The one true indentation style lmao -->
                public class HelloWorld {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello, world!");<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }<br>
            </code>
        </p><p>
            The idea behind Java is to provide strong support for object-oriented programming, no? And whatever identifier
            comes right after the word <code>class</code> is the type of whatever those objects are, right?
        </p><p>
            Then what, pray tell, is a "HelloWorld"? An object is supposed to be a <em>thing</em>, like an apple or
            a rock or (far too often) a factory or abstract idea. But a "HelloWorld" isn't a thing. Calling this class
            a "HelloWorld" makes no sense. It goes against the idea of object-oriented programming. It's much more like
            program name declarations in Fortran or Cobol.
        </p><p>
            Java has no naked functions. Every function has to be a "method", which has to be inside of a class. The result of
            this is that the programmer who learns Java as their first language gets used to the
            <code>subject.verb(object);</code> pattern, which limits their thinking. Programming languages can be much more
            expressive than that! Imagine trying to make sense of C's <code>qsort()</code>, or literally anything in a ML
            language, when you've been accustomed to nothing but the <code>subject.verb(object)</code> pattern.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>The stuff in java.lang is clunky and dumb</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Java has primitive <code>int</code>s, and it also has an <code>Integer</code> class. I know the historical reasons
            for this design decision (performance concerns), but the newbie programmer does not. For what logical, sensible reason
            should a language have both of those things? Why shouldn't you be able to treat an <code>int</code> like any other
            object?
        </p>
        <p>
            Compare the following:
            <code>
                print("foo")<br>
                printf("foo\n");<br>
                println!("foo");<br>
                std::cout << "foo\n";<br>
                System.out.println("foo");<br>
            </code>
            Now I for one happen to think that the way a language handles standard I/O is a very important feature of the
            language. I also happen to think that newbies should not use autocompletion, so that they can learn how to
            look up documentation for library code. <code>System.out.println();</code> is so verbose that when I find myself
            in the unfortunate position of needing to write in Java, I often write a <code>static void print()</code> to
            wrap it. This problem could've been fixed if Java supported naked functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have more opinions about Java but I'm not writing them today.
