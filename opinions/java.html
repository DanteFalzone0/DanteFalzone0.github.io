            My Opinions about the Java Programming Language

            A <a href="https://github.com/pdush">friend of mine</a> recently undertook to learn programming. For their first programming language they chose Python,
            which I think is an excellent first language; it is a powerful, expressive, and useful language that is very easy
            for beginners to learn. I may be a little biased by the fact that Python was <em>my</em> first language, but I think
            those familiar with Python would agree.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I asked this person what language they would like to learn after Python, and they said they were thinking of doing
            Java, because they knew someone who was doing stuff in Java. I told them that they shouldn't learn Java until they've
            learned a few other languages first, but I wasn't able to give a super good explanation as to why. So here I hope to
            explain myself.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Java is badly designed</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>    
            Consider the following Java code:
        </p><p> 
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {<br>
                    public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
                        System.out.println("Hello, world!");<br>
                    }<br>
                }<br>
            </code>
        </p><p>
            The idea behind Java is to provide strong support for object-oriented programming, no? And whatever identifier
            comes right after the word `class` is the type of whatever those objects are, right?
        </p><p>
            Then what, pray tell, is a "HelloWorld"? An object is supposed to be a <em>thing</em>, like an apple or
            a rock or (far too often) a factory or abstract idea. But a "HelloWorld" isn't a thing. Calling this class
            a "HelloWorld" makes no sense.
        </p>
